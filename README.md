📈 Univariate Time Series Forecasting using ARIMA and SARIMA

This project focuses on forecasting monthly grocery store sales using ARIMA and SARIMA time series models.
The goal is to understand sales patterns, detect seasonality, and forecast future demand to assist in business and inventory planning.

🔍 Project Overview

Performed univariate time series forecasting on monthly sales data.
Explored trends and seasonal patterns to understand sales behavior.
Built ARIMA and SARIMA models to predict future sales.
Compared actual vs predicted values using visualizations.
Generated insights to support better inventory and supply chain decisions.

📁 Key Steps & Methodology
1️⃣ Data Collection & Preprocessing

Collected monthly sales data for a grocery store.

Handled missing values and cleaned the dataset.

Converted the date column into a proper time-series index.

2️⃣ Exploratory Time Series Analysis

Identified trends, seasonality, and demand fluctuations.

Visualized sales behavior over time.

3️⃣ Model Building

Applied ARIMA model for non-seasonal forecasting.
Applied SARIMA model to capture seasonal patterns.
Evaluated model performance through residual checks and visual comparison.

4️⃣ Forecasting & Interpretation

Forecasted future monthly sales.

Visualized actual vs predicted values.

Provided insights for demand planning and inventory optimization.

🛠 Technologies Used
